Hello, Godotneers! Thank you very much for watching this video. This repository contains the little game we used in the video. You can use it to follow along with the video or to experiment with the code. 

## Using this repository
The main branch contains the code as it was at the end of the video and it also includes some code that was part of the article, e.g. the path fixer. There is a `start` branch that contains the code as it was at the beginning of the video. You can use this branch to follow along with the video if you'd like.

If you don't know how to use git, you can also download the code as a zip file using these links:

- [Download the code as a zip file (main branch, at the end of the video)](https://github.com/godotneers/saving-loading-video/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- [Download the code as a zip file (start branch, at the beginning of the video)](https://github.com/godotneers/saving-loading-video/archive/refs/heads/start.zip)

## Additional material

Be sure to also check the [article on saved game compatibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotneers/saving-loading-video/main/godotneers-ensuring-saved-game-compatibility.pdf), it contains a lot of useful strategies to ensure your saved games are compatible across different versions of your game.
